## In this lab, you will run through the steps listed for each of the tasks in the slides but for a docker image instead of google instance. 

1. Install Terraform in your local system.
   
2. Create a tf configuration for running docker resource. You can take help from this tutorial.
   
3. Apply the initial resources.
   
4. Change infrastructure (your choice of what change it is).
   
5. Create a plan and use the plan to make changes to the resource.
   
6. Make destructive changes (like removing one of the docker images).

7. Destory the complete resource.
   
8. Create resource with dependencies (implicit and explicit).
